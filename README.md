Curriculum vitae of Max Thrush Hukill.
Thank you for visiting! Feel free to peruse some sample problem sets, posters, reports, and code I've put up.
Notice, the code for the cricket neuroethology and bumblebee foraging projects has yet to be included, as these manuscripts are still in the review process. These projects will be added to the Statistical_research folder upon completion. Thank you for your patience!

Please reach out to maxhukill@gmail.com with questions/comments/one-liners/recipes/chess openings/or more!
